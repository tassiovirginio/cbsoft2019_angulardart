    <h2>Journal First Submissions</h2>

    SBES is partnering with international journals to incorporate Journal First papers into the SBES 2019 Research
    track.<br><br>

    The IEEE Software and SBC Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development (JSERD) have confirmed their
    partnership with SBES 2019. Authors of journal-first papers accepted in those journals will be invited to present
    their research work at SBES. This offers an opportunity for authors to discuss their work with the community as well
    as enrich the technical program of SBES.<br>
    <br>
    The following evaluation criteria will be used to select journal first papers to SBES 2019:<br>
    <br>
    - The paper describes original results that are not extensions of previous conference papers.<br>
    - The paper was accepted for publication in the journal no earlier than January 1st, 2017.<br>
    - The paper has not been presented at any other conference as journal first.<br>
    - The selected papers will be presented in the technical program of the SBES Research Track. At least one author per
    selected journal first paper will need to register and attend the symposium to present it.<br>
    <br>
    - Regarding journal first papers published in JSERD, we accept submissions of papers from the following categories:
    Research Articles, Case Studies, and Review.
    <br><br>
    - Regarding journal-first papers published in IEEE Software, we accept peer-reviewed research papers (not
    editorially-reviewed or invited papers).
    <br><br>
    Authors interested in presenting journal first papers at SBES 2019 should send an email to (<a
        href="mailto:rafaelp@pucrs.br">rafaelp@pucrs.br</a>) with the subject "Journal First - SBES 2019" by May 31st,
    2019. The following information must be provided: (i) paper title; (ii) list of authors; (iii) web link to the
    paper; and (iv) a short statement on how the work satisfies the criteria above.<br>

    <h2>Best Paper Award</h2>

    <p>Every year the SBES Steering Committee appoints a committee to award the symposium's best papers. Awarded papers
        of the Research Track are announced during the event.</p>

    <p>The five best papers of the Research Track will be invited to submit an extended version in English to the
        Research category of the Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development (JSERD).</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Outstanding Reviewer Award</h2>

    <p>SBES 2019 acknowledges the generosity of the reviewers who give their time and best effort to referee submitted
        papers. The progress of scientific growth depends on dedicated colleagues, who aim to further the development of
        technology by offering their attention and passion when reviewing the papers. A certificate of Outstanding
        Reviewer will be awarded to reviewer/s who submitted outstanding quality reviews to SBES. The evaluation will be
        based on two criteria: quality; and usefulness of reviews, as evaluated by the paper authors and PC Chairs.</p>

    <h2>Paper Categories</h2>

    <p>Authors of the Research Track papers, 'after the abstract' in the submission form, should indicate which one of
        the following categories their paper most closely adheres to. This intends to establish a consistent set of
        expectations in the review process.</p>

    <p><b>Analytical</b>: A paper in which the main contribution relies on new algorithms or mathematical theory.
        Examples include new bug prediction techniques, model transformations, algorithms for dynamic and static
        analysis, and reliability analysis. Such a contribution must be evaluated with a convincing analysis of the
        algorithmic details, whether through a proof, complexity analysis, or runtime analysis, among others and
        depending on the objectives.</p>

    <p><b>Experimental (primary study)</b>: A paper in which the main contribution is the experimental study of a
        software engineering technology or phenomenon. This includes controlled experiments, quasi experiments, case
        studies, and surveys of professionals reporting qualitative or quantitative data and analysis results. Such a
        contribution will be judged on its study design, appropriateness and correctness of its analysis, and threats to
        validity. Replications are welcome. </p>

    <p><b>Literature review (secondary study)</b>: A paper in which the main contribution is the synthesis of primary
        studies. Examples include systematic reviews and systematic mappings. Such a contribution should follow a sound
        methodology and provide a comprehensive coverage of the relevant literature. Moreover, it should answer relevant
        research questions with a deep synthesis of the results. Contributions that only provide metadata analysis
        (e.g., relevant authors, publications density by year, most influential papers, etc.) are discouraged. </p>

    <p><b>Technological</b>: A paper in which the main contribution is of a technical nature. This includes novel tools,
        modeling languages, infrastructures, and other technologies. Such a contribution does not necessarily need to be
        evaluated with humans. However, clear arguments, backed up by evidence as appropriate, must show how and why the
        technology is beneficial, whether it is in automating or supporting some user task, refining our modeling
        capabilities, improving some key system property, etc.</p>

    <p> <b>Methodological</b>: A paper in which the main contribution is a coherent system of broad principles and
        practices to interpret or solve a problem. This includes novel requirements elicitation methods, process models,
        design methods, development approaches, programming paradigms, and other methodologies. The authors should
        provide convincing arguments with commensurate experiences, as well as explain why a new method is needed and
        what the benefits of the proposed method are.</p>

    <h2>Manuscript Preparation Double Blind Review And Submission</h2>

    <p> Papers can be submitted in Portuguese or English. Submission in English is strongly encouraged since the
        symposium proceedings will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library. The acceptance of a paper implies that at
        least one of its authors will register for the symposium to present it.</p>
    <p> All submissions must be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and must comply with the ACM 2-column conference
        (ACM_SigConf) format available at <a
            href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>.
        They must be no longer than 10 pages, including all figures and references.</p>
    <p> Papers should be submitted electronically through JEMS (<a
            href="http://submissoes.sbc.org.br">http://submissoes.sbc.org.br</a>). All technical research papers should
        indicate after the abstract the language and one or more of the aforementioned categories. Submissions that are
        not in compliance with the required submission format or that are out of the scope of the symposium, or that
        were submitted or published in any other forum (conference or journal), will be rejected without review. All
        other papers will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. During the review process, we may
        request a rebuttal; in this case, authors will have access to reviews and may argue and answer questions from
        the referees before the final acceptance/rejection decision. The rebuttal is limited to a plain text up to 4,000
        characters.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Double Blind Submission</h2>

    SBES 2019 will follow a double-blind review process. All submitted papers should conceal the identity of the
    authors. Both author names and affiliations must be omitted. In addition, the following rules should be
    addressed:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>You should ensure that citations to your own related work are written in the third person. For example, you
            must write “the previous work of Silva et al.” as opposed to “our previous work.”</li>

        <li>In the submitted paper, you should not mention any artifact in a repository or website that allows
            identifying the authorship. If you need to make available any artifact, please anonymize it in the
            repository/website.</li>

        <li>If the submitted paper is a follow up of your previous work, you may anonymize the reference in the
            submitted paper. For example, “the previous work of Silva et al.” can be adapted to "based on the previous
            work [X]", and the reference at the end of the paper can be presented as "[X] Anonymous authors. Not
            presented due to double blind review."</li>

        <li>After the paper acceptance, you can include all the paper information (without anonymization) in the
            camera-ready version.</li>

        <li>In case you have any questions about the preparation of your paper following the double-blind rules, send an
            email to the program chairs with the subject "SBES: question about the double-blind rules."</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2>Mentoring Program</h2>

    <p> Authors that have never published in the SBES Research Track or at other international prestigious conferences
        in the field (on the program chair discretion), and that intend to submit a paper to the Research Track, may
        request to participate in the mentoring program. The program chair will assign a member of the Program Committee
        to make a preliminary assessment of the work and give feedback before the submission deadline, increasing the
        chances of less-experienced authors.</p>

    <p> Check the deadline to join the program in the Important Dates section, but note that we encourage the request to
        be made as soon as possible, since the number of papers in this program is limited and the assignment will be
        made on a first-come-first served basis.</p>

    <p> <b>ATTENTION</b>: to join this program none of the authors may have previous publications in any SBES edition or
        any
        international prestigious conferences. The request must be made exclusively by email (<a
            href="mailto:Marco.Gerosa@nau.edu">Marco.Gerosa@nau.edu</a>) with the subject "Participation in the SBES
        Mentoring Program." You should include in the email body the title of the
        work, the full list of authors, and the abstract.</p>
