    <h2>Journal First Submissions</h2>

    SBES is partnering with international journals to incorporate Journal First papers into the SBES 2019 Research
    track.<br><br>

    The IEEE Software and SBC Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development (JSERD) have confirmed their
    partnership with SBES 2019. Authors of journal-first papers accepted in those journals will be invited to present
    their research work at SBES. This offers an opportunity for authors to discuss their work with the community as well
    as enrich the technical program of SBES.<br>
    <br>
    The following evaluation criteria will be used to select journal first papers to SBES 2019:<br>
    <br>
    - The paper describes original results that are not extensions of previous conference papers.<br>
    - The paper was accepted for publication in the journal no earlier than January 1st, 2017.<br>
    - The paper has not been presented at any other conference as journal first.<br>
    - The selected papers will be presented in the technical program of the SBES Research Track. At least one author per
    selected journal first paper will need to register and attend the symposium to present it.<br>
    <br>
    - Regarding journal first papers published in JSERD, we accept submissions of papers from the following categories:
    Research Articles, Case Studies, and Review.
    <br><br>
    - Regarding journal-first papers published in IEEE Software, we accept peer-reviewed research papers (not
    editorially-reviewed or invited papers).
    <br><br>
    Authors interested in presenting journal first papers at SBES 2019 should send an email to (<a
        href="mailto:rafaelp@pucrs.br">rafaelp@pucrs.br</a>) with the subject "Journal First - SBES 2019" by May 31st,
    2019. The following information must be provided: (i) paper title; (ii) list of authors; (iii) web link to the
    paper; and (iv) a short statement on how the work satisfies the criteria above.<br>

    <br>

    <hr>

    <h2>Best Paper Award</h2>

    <p>Every year the SBES Steering Committee appoints a committee to award the symposium's best papers. Awarded papers
        of the Research Track are announced during the event.</p>

    <p>The five best papers of the Research Track will be invited to submit an extended version in English to the
        Research category of the Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development (JSERD).</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Outstanding Reviewer Award</h2>

    <p>SBES 2019 acknowledges the generosity of the reviewers who give their time and best effort to referee submitted
        papers. The progress of scientific growth depends on dedicated colleagues, who aim to further the development of
        technology by offering their attention and passion when reviewing the papers. A certificate of Outstanding
        Reviewer will be awarded to reviewer/s who submitted outstanding quality reviews to SBES. The evaluation will be
        based on two criteria: quality; and usefulness of reviews, as evaluated by the paper authors and PC Chairs.</p>

    <h2>Paper Categories</h2>

    <p>Authors of the Research Track papers, 'after the abstract' in the submission form, should indicate which one of
        the following categories their paper most closely adheres to. This intends to establish a consistent set of
        expectations in the review process.</p>

    <p><b>Analytical</b>: A paper in which the main contribution relies on new algorithms or mathematical theory.
        Examples include new bug prediction techniques, model transformations, algorithms for dynamic and static
        analysis, and reliability analysis. Such a contribution must be evaluated with a convincing analysis of the
        algorithmic details, whether through a proof, complexity analysis, or runtime analysis, among others and
        depending on the objectives.</p>

    <p><b>Experimental (primary study)</b>: A paper in which the main contribution is the experimental study of a
        software engineering technology or phenomenon. This includes controlled experiments, quasi experiments, case
        studies, and surveys of professionals reporting qualitative or quantitative data and analysis results. Such a
        contribution will be judged on its study design, appropriateness and correctness of its analysis, and threats to
        validity. Replications are welcome. </p>

    <p><b>Literature review (secondary study)</b>: A paper in which the main contribution is the synthesis of primary
        studies. Examples include systematic reviews and systematic mappings. Such a contribution should follow a sound
        methodology and provide a comprehensive coverage of the relevant literature. Moreover, it should answer relevant
        research questions with a deep synthesis of the results. Contributions that only provide metadata analysis
        (e.g., relevant authors, publications density by year, most influential papers, etc.) are discouraged. </p>

    <p><b>Technological</b>: A paper in which the main contribution is of a technical nature. This includes novel tools,
        modeling languages, infrastructures, and other technologies. Such a contribution does not necessarily need to be
        evaluated with humans. However, clear arguments, backed up by evidence as appropriate, must show how and why the
        technology is beneficial, whether it is in automating or supporting some user task, refining our modeling
        capabilities, improving some key system property, etc.</p>

    <p> <b>Methodological</b>: A paper in which the main contribution is a coherent system of broad principles and
        practices to interpret or solve a problem. This includes novel requirements elicitation methods, process models,
        design methods, development approaches, programming paradigms, and other methodologies. The authors should
        provide convincing arguments with commensurate experiences, as well as explain why a new method is needed and
        what the benefits of the proposed method are.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Manuscript Preparation Double Blind Review And Submission</h2>

    <p> Papers can be submitted in Portuguese or English. Submission in English is strongly encouraged since the
        symposium proceedings will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library. The acceptance of a paper implies that at
        least one of its authors will register for the symposium to present it.</p>
    <p> All submissions must be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and must comply with the ACM 2-column conference
        (ACM_SigConf) format available at <a
            href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>.
        They must be no longer than 10 pages, including all figures and references.</p>
    <p> Papers should be submitted electronically through JEMS (<a
            href="http://submissoes.sbc.org.br">http://submissoes.sbc.org.br</a>). All technical research papers should
        indicate after the abstract the language and one or more of the aforementioned categories. Submissions that are
        not in compliance with the required submission format or that are out of the scope of the symposium, or that
        were submitted or published in any other forum (conference or journal), will be rejected without review. All
        other papers will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. During the review process, we may
        request a rebuttal; in this case, authors will have access to reviews and may argue and answer questions from
        the referees before the final acceptance/rejection decision. The rebuttal is limited to a plain text up to 4,000
        characters.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Double Blind Submission</h2>

    SBES 2019 will follow a double-blind review process. All submitted papers should conceal the identity of the
    authors. Both author names and affiliations must be omitted. In addition, the following rules should be
    addressed:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>You should ensure that citations to your own related work are written in the third person. For example, you
            must write “the previous work of Silva et al.” as opposed to “our previous work.”</li>

        <li>In the submitted paper, you should not mention any artifact in a repository or website that allows
            identifying the authorship. If you need to make available any artifact, please anonymize it in the
            repository/website.</li>

        <li>If the submitted paper is a follow up of your previous work, you may anonymize the reference in the
            submitted paper. For example, “the previous work of Silva et al.” can be adapted to "based on the previous
            work [X]", and the reference at the end of the paper can be presented as "[X] Anonymous authors. Not
            presented due to double blind review."</li>

        <li>After the paper acceptance, you can include all the paper information (without anonymization) in the
            camera-ready version.</li>

        <li>In case you have any questions about the preparation of your paper following the double-blind rules, send an
            email to the program chairs with the subject "SBES: question about the double-blind rules."</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2>Mentoring Program</h2>

    <p> Authors that have never published in the SBES Research Track or at other international prestigious conferences
        in the field (on the program chair discretion), and that intend to submit a paper to the Research Track, may
        request to participate in the mentoring program. The program chair will assign a member of the Program Committee
        to make a preliminary assessment of the work and give feedback before the submission deadline, increasing the
        chances of less-experienced authors.</p>

    <p> Check the deadline to join the program in the Important Dates section, but note that we encourage the request to
        be made as soon as possible, since the number of papers in this program is limited and the assignment will be
        made on a first-come-first served basis.</p>

    <p> <b>ATTENTION</b>: to join this program none of the authors may have previous publications in any SBES edition or
        any
        international prestigious conferences. The request must be made exclusively by email (<a
            href="mailto:Marco.Gerosa@nau.edu">Marco.Gerosa@nau.edu</a>) with the subject "Participation in the SBES
        Mentoring Program." You should include in the email body the title of the
        work, the full list of authors, and the abstract.</p>

    <h2>SUBMISSÕES PARA JOURNAL-FIRST</h2>

    O SBES está fazendo parcerias com revistas internacionais para incorporar os artigos submetidos como Journal First
    na trilha de pesquisa do SBES 2019.<br>
    <br>
    A IEEE Software e o Journal de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento de Engenharia de Software (JSERD), agora como periódico
    mantido pela SBC, confirmaram sua parceria com o SBES 2019. Os autores dos artigos journal-first aceitos nesses
    periódicos poderão apresentar seu trabalho de pesquisa no SBES. Isso oferece uma oportunidade para os autores
    discutirem seu trabalho com a comunidade, bem como enriquece o programa técnico do SBES.<br>
    <br>
    Os seguintes critérios de avaliação serão usados ​​para selecionar os artigos journal-first no SBES 2019:<br>
    <br>
    - O artigo descreve resultados originais que não são extensões de documentos anteriores publicados em
    conferências.<br>
    - O artigo foi aceito para publicação no periódico até 1º de janeiro de 2017.<br>
    - O artigo não foi apresentado em nenhuma outra conferência como journal-first.<br>
    - Os trabalhos selecionados serão apresentados no programa técnico da trilha de pesquisa do SBES. Pelo menos um
    autor por journal-first selecionado precisará se registrar e participar do simpósio para apresentá-lo.<br>
    <br>
    - Em relação aos artigos publicados no JSERD, aceitamos submissões de trabalhos das seguintes categorias: artigos de
    pesquisa, estudos de caso e revisão.<br>
    <br>
    - Com relação aos artigos publicados no IEEE Software, aceitamos artigos de pesquisa revisados ​​por pares (não são
    aceitos artigos revisados ​​editorialmente ou trabalhos convidados).<br>
    <br>
    Os autores interessados ​​em apresentar artigos journal-first no SBES 2019 devem enviar um e-mail para
    (rafaelp@pucrs.br) com o assunto "Journal First - SBES 2019" até 31 de maio de 2019. As seguintes informações devem
    ser fornecidas: (i) título do trabalho; (ii) lista de autores; (iii) link para o journal; e (iv) uma breve
    declaração sobre como o trabalho satisfaz os critérios acima.
    <br>

    <h2>CATEGORIAS DE ARTIGOS</h2>

    <p>Os autores dos artigos da trilha de pesquisa, 'após o resumo' no formulário de submissão, devem indicar em qual
        das categorias a seguir seu artigo melhor se classifica. Isso pretende estabelecer um conjunto consistente de
        expectativas no processo de revisão.</p>

    <p>Analítico: Um artigo no qual a principal contribuição se baseia em novos algoritmos ou teoria matemática. Os
        exemplos incluem novas técnicas de previsão de bugs, transformações de modelo, algoritmos para análise dinâmica
        e estática e análise de confiabilidade. Tal contribuição deve ser avaliada com uma análise convincente dos
        detalhes algorítmicos, seja através de uma prova, análise de complexidade, ou análise de tempo de execução,
        entre outros.</p>

    <p>Experimental (estudo primário): Um artigo no qual a principal contribuição é o estudo experimental de uma
        tecnologia ou fenômeno de engenharia de software. Isso inclui experimentos controlados, quasi-experimentos,
        estudos de caso e pesquisas com profissionais que relatam dados qualitativos ou quantitativos e resultados de
        análises. Tal contribuição será julgada no desenho do estudo, adequação e correção de sua análise e ameaças à
        validade. As replicações são bem vindas.</p>

    <p>Revisão de literatura (estudo secundário): Um artigo em que a principal contribuição é a síntese de estudos
        primários. Exemplos incluem revisões sistemáticas e mapeamentos sistemáticos. Essa contribuição deve seguir uma
        metodologia sólida e fornecer uma cobertura abrangente da literatura relevante. Além disso, deve responder a
        questões de pesquisa relevantes com uma síntese profunda dos resultados. Contribuições que fornecem apenas
        análise de metadados (por exemplo, autores relevantes, publicações de densidade por ano, artigos mais
        influentes, etc.) são desencorajadas.</p>

    <p>Tecnológico: Um artigo em que a principal contribuição é de natureza técnica. Isso inclui novas ferramentas,
        linguagens de modelagem, infraestruturas e outras tecnologias. Tal contribuição não precisa necessariamente ser
        avaliada com seres humanos. No entanto, argumentos claros, apoiados por evidências, conforme apropriado, devem
        mostrar como e por que a tecnologia é benéfica, seja na automação ou suporte a alguma tarefa do usuário,
        refinando nossos recursos de modelagem, melhorando algumas propriedades importantes do sistema, etc.</p>

    <p>Metodológico: Um artigo no qual a principal contribuição é um sistema coerente de princípios e práticas
        abrangentes para interpretar ou resolver um problema. Isso inclui novos métodos de elicitação de requisitos,
        modelos de processos, métodos de design, abordagens de desenvolvimento, paradigmas de programação e outras
        metodologias. Os autores devem fornecer argumentos convincentes com experiências proporcionais, bem como
        explicar por que um novo método é necessário e quais são os benefícios do método proposto.</p>


    <hr>

    <h2>PREPARAÇÃO DE ARTIGOS, REVISÃO DOUBLE-BLIND E SUBMISSÃO</h2>

    <p> Os trabalhos podem ser submetidos em Português ou Inglês. A submissão em inglês é fortemente encorajada, uma vez que os anais do simpósio serão indexados na Biblioteca Digital ACM. A aceitação de um artigo implica que pelo menos um de seus autores fará inscrição para participar do simpósio para apresentá-lo.</p>
    <p> Todas as submissões devem estar no formato Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) e devem estar de acordo com o formato ACM de 2 colunas (ACM_SigConf) disponível em http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. Eles não devem ter mais de 10 páginas, incluindo todas as figuras e referências.</p>
    <p> Os trabalhos devem ser submetidos eletronicamente através do JEMS (http://submissoes.sbc.org.br). Todos os trabalhos de pesquisa técnica devem indicar, após o resumo, o idioma e uma ou mais das categorias acima mencionadas. As submissões que não estiverem em conformidade com o formato de submissão exigido ou que estiverem fora do escopo do simpósio, ou que foram enviadas ou publicadas em qualquer outro fórum (conferência ou revista), serão rejeitadas sem revisão. Todos os outros trabalhos serão revisados ​​por pelo menos três membros do comitê do programa. Durante o processo de revisão, podemos solicitar um rebuttal. Neste caso, os autores terão acesso às revisões e poderão argumentar e responder às perguntas dos revisores antes da decisão final de aceitação / rejeição. A réplica é limitada a um texto simples de até 4.000 caracteres.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>SUBMISSÃO DOUBLE-BLIND</h2>

    O SBES 2019 seguirá um processo de revisão double-blind. Todos os trabalhos submetidos devem ocultar a identidade dos autores. Ambos os nomes de autores e afiliações devem ser omitidos. Além disso, as seguintes regras devem ser abordadas:
<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Você deve garantir que as citações de seu trabalho relacionado sejam escritas na terceira pessoa. Por exemplo, você deve escrever “o trabalho anterior de Silva et al.” Em oposição ao “nosso trabalho anterior”.</li>

        <li>No artigo submetido, você não deve mencionar nenhum artefato em um repositório ou site que permita identificar a autoria. Se você precisar disponibilizar qualquer artefato, faça de forma anônima no repositório / website.</li>

        <li>Se o trabalho submetido for uma evolução de seu trabalho anterior, você poderá anonimizar a referência no artigo submetido. Por exemplo, “o trabalho anterior de Silva et al.” Pode ser adaptado para “baseado no trabalho anterior [X]”, e a referência no final do artigo pode ser apresentada como “[X] autores anônimos devido à revisão em dupla ocultação".</li>
    </ul>

    Após a aceitação do artigo, você pode incluir todas as informações (sem anonimização) na versão final.
    <br>
    <br>
    Caso você tenha alguma dúvida sobre a preparação do seu trabalho seguindo as regras de submissão double-blind, envie um e-mail para os coordenadores de programa com o assunto "SBES: pergunta sobre as regras de double-blind".
<br>

    <hr>

    <h2>PROGRAMA DE MENTORIA</h2>

    <p> Autores que nunca publicaram na trilha de pesquisa do SBES ou em outras conferências internacionais de prestígio, e que pretendem submeter um artigo em 2019 podem solicitar a participação no programa de mentoria. O coordenador do programa designará um membro do Comitê de Programa para fazer uma avaliação preliminar do trabalho e fornecer feedback antes do prazo de submissão, aumentando as chances de autores menos experientes.</p>

    <p> Verifique o prazo para participar do programa na seção Datas Importantes, mas note que incentivamos a fazer a solicitação o mais rápido possível, pois o número de artigos neste programa é limitado e a distribuição será feita por ordem de solicitação.</p>

    <p> ATENÇÃO: para participar deste programa, nenhum dos autores pode ter publicações anteriores em qualquer edição do SBES ou em qualquer conferência internacional de prestígio. A solicitação deve ser feita exclusivamente por email (Marco.Gerosa@nau.edu) com o assunto "Participação no Programa de Mentoria do SBES". Você deve incluir no corpo do e-mail o título do trabalho, a lista completa de autores e o resumo.</p>
