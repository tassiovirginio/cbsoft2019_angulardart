<page language="en,pt" title="XXXIII SBES - Poster">

    <p>SBES 2019 will feature a Poster Track, which will be an additional opportunity for researchers and practitioners
        to present, showcase, and discuss their most recent advances, ideas, experiences, and challenges in the field of
        software engineering.</p>

    <p>There is no open call for poster submissions for SBES 2019. Instead, the Posters Track will be organized on an
        invitation basis. Some submissions to the Research, Insightful Ideas and Emerging Results, and Education tracks
        will be invited by the chairs to be considered as posters, which will also be presented to the plenary during
        SBES. The authors of an invited poster will also submit a 2-page extended abstract following the SBES submission
        guidelines to be published in the event proceedings.</p>
