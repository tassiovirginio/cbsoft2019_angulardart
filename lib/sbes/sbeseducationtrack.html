    <br>

    <p>
       The Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES), annually promoted by the Brazilian Computer Society
        (SBC), is the premier Software Engineering event in Latin America. SBES is held in conjunction with CBSoft -
        Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice. The CBSoft program includes technical research sessions,
        insightful ideas sessions, industry sessions, invited talks, courses, tutorials, panels, demonstration of
        software tools, Ph.D. and M.Sc. theses workshop, and several other satellite events. It traditionally gathers
        nearly 600 people, including academics, practitioners, and students.</p>

    <p>In 2019, SBES will include three tracks. The Research Track publishes solid results with a strong contribution to
        the Software Engineering community. The Insightful Ideas and Emerging Results Track provides opportunity for
        researchers and practitioners to submit and present innovative and promising ideas and results in early stages
        of research. The Education Track (former FEES - Forum of Education in Software Engineering) publishes papers
        that address challenges, innovations, and best practices in Software Engineering education. For details of the
        Research Track, and Insightful Ideas and Emerging Results Track, please refer to the specific calls for papers
        or access the conference website.</p>

    <h2>THE EDUCATION TRACK</h2>
    <p>SBES Education Track welcomes quality submissions covering curriculum development, empirical studies, best
        practices, personal or institutional experiences, and conceptual or theoretical work are particularly invited.
        Papers on this track are reviewed based on their originality, relevance, technical soundness, and clarity of
        presentation.</p>

    <p>Papers submitted to the SBES Education Track must not have been simultaneously submitted to any other forum
        (conference or journal), nor should they have already been published elsewhere.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>MANUSCRIPT PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION</h3>
    <p>
        Papers must be written in Portuguese or English. Submissions in English are strongly encouraged since the
        symposium proceedings are indexed in the ACM Digital Library. The acceptance of a paper implies that at least
        one of its authors will register for the symposium to present it.</p>
    <p>
        All submissions must be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and must comply with the ACM 2-column conference
        format available at</p>

    <a
        href="http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html">http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html</a>.
    <p>
        Papers must be no longer than 10 pages, including all figures and references.
    </p>
    <p>Papers should be electronically submitted through the JEMS system (http://submissoes.sbc.org.br). Submissions
        that are not in compliance with the required submission format or that are out of the scope of the Education
        Track will be rejected without reviewing. All other papers will be reviewed by at least three Program Committee
        members.</p>

    <p>The review process includes a rebuttal period in which the authors will have access to the reviewers’ comments
        and may argue and answer questions from the reviewers before the final acceptance/rejection decision. The
        rebuttal is limited to a plain text up to 4,000 characters (including spaces).</p>
