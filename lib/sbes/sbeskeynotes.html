    <h2>Shortbio</h2>

    <p>Dr. Margaret-Anne Storey is a Professor of Computer Science and the Co-Director of the Matrix Institute for
        Applied Data Science at the University of Victoria. She holds a Canada Research Chair in Human and Social
        Aspects of Software Engineering and is a member of the Royal Society of Canadaâ€™s College of New Scholars,
        Artists, and Scientists. She held the Lise Meitner Guest Professorship at Lund University in Sweden from 2016 to
        2018, a professorship that promotes gender diversity in science.</p>
    <p>
        Together with her students and collaborators, she seeks to understand how software tools, communication media,
        data visualizations, and social theories can be leveraged to improve how software engineers and knowledge
        workers explore, understand, analyze and share complex information and knowledge. She has published widely on
        these topics and collaborates extensively with high-tech companies and non-profit organizations to ensure
        real-world applicability of her research contributions and tools. Over the past several years, she has
        collaborated with product teams and researchers at Microsoft to understand developer satisfaction and developer
        productivity, with the goal of improving their engineering systems and processes.</p>

    <h2>Shortbio</h2>
    <p>Dr. James Herbsleb is a Professor in the Institute for Software Research in the School of Computer Science at
        Carnegie Mellon University. His research interests lie primarily in the intersection of software engineering,
        computer-supported cooperative work, and socio-technical systems, focusing on such areas as geographically
        distributed development teams and large-scale open source development. His research has won several awards,
        including the ICSE Most Influential Paper award in 2010, and several distinguished papers and best paper awards
        at ICSE, CWCW, ESEM, and Academy of Management.
    </p>
    <p>He was awarded the SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award in 2016, and previously the Alan Newell Award for Research
        Excellence in 2014. For about two decades, he has had the privilege of working with outstanding colleagues and
        students to try to understand the complex and dynamic relationship between human collaboration and the software
        that humans design and use.
