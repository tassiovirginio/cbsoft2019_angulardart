        <h3>
        Publish or Perish<br>
        Questioning the Impact of Our Research on the Software Developer<br>
        </h3>
    </b>
    </center>
    <br>
    How often do we pause to consider how we, as a community, decide which developer problems we address, or how well we are doing at evaluating our solutions within real development contexts? Many of our research contributions in software engineering can be considered as purely technical. Yet somewhere, at some time, a software developer may be impacted by our research. In this talk, I invite the community to question the impact of our research on software developer productivity. To guide the discussion, I first paint a picture of the modern-day developer and the challenges they experience. I then present 4+1 views of software engineering research --- views that concern research context, method choice, research paradigms, theoretical knowledge and real-world impact. I demonstrate how these views can be used to design, communicate and distinguish individual studies, but also how they can be used to compose a critical perspective of our research at a community level. To conclude, I propose structural changes to our collective research and publishing activities --- changes to provoke a more expeditious consideration of the many challenges facing today's software developer.<br>

    Dr. Margaret-Anne Storey is a Professor of Computer Science and the Co-Director of the Matrix Institute for Applied Data Science at the University of Victoria. She holds a Canada Research Chair in Human and Social Aspects of Software Engineering and is a member of the Royal Society of Canada’s College of New Scholars, Artists, and Scientists. She held the Lise Meitner Guest Professorship at Lund University in Sweden from 2016 to 2018, a professorship that promotes gender diversity in science. Together with her students and collaborators, she seeks to understand how software tools, communication media, data visualizations, and social theories can be leveraged to improve how software engineers and knowledge workers explore, understand, analyze and share complex information and knowledge. She has published widely on these topics and collaborates extensively with high-tech companies and non-profit organizations to ensure real-world applicability of her research contributions and tools. Over the past several years, she has collaborated with product teams and researchers at Microsoft to understand developer satisfaction and developer productivity, with the goal of improving their engineering systems and processes.<br>

    <p>In software engineering research, human characteristics have traditionally been treated as peripheral. We have also seen, over the 50 years or so that software engineering has existed as a field of research, nearly continuous hand-wringing about our unsatisfyingly small impact on practice. In this talk, I argue that these two traits are closely-related and stem from the same source, which is treating the way humans think, act, and coordinate as outside the core concerns of our discipline. We need a fundamental shift in our culture, training, time horizon, and research focus in order to set the field on a path of long-term progress.</p>

    <p>Dr. James Herbsleb is a Professor in the Institute for Software Research in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. His research interests lie primarily in the intersection of software engineering, computer-supported cooperative work, and socio-technical systems, focusing on such areas as geographically distributed development teams and large-scale open source development. His research has won several awards, including the ICSE Most Influential Paper award in 2010, and several distinguished papers and best paper awards at ICSE, CWCW, ESEM, and Academy of Management. He was awarded the SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award in 2016, and previously the Alan Newell Award for Research Excellence in 2014. For about two decades, he has had the privilege of working with outstanding colleagues and students to try to understand the complex and dynamic relationship between human collaboration and the software that humans design and use.</p>

                The only journey is the one within”: understanding software design degradation as a process<br>
                </h3>

    <p>Design degradation implies on a systematic deterioration of various attributes of software quality, such as comprehensibility, maintainability and others. Many symptoms in a software, such smells, are used as a (limited) partial sign of design degradation. Many techniques for combating such degradation symptoms, such as refactoring, have been employed by developers in practice. However, design degradation in a software project is often a very long, slow, and complex process; the same holds for the process of combating such design degradation. Both processes cannot be truly understood if they are studied in terms of isolated events. For example, focusing on the observation of each smell or each single refactoring that was introduced in a commit does not offer enough context to truly understand how the design as a whole is either degrading or recovering from it. Moreover, activities that contribute to both processes are often: (i) intertwined with other daily activities in software development, such as adding or enhancing features or even fixing bugs, and (ii) intertwined among themselves – e.g., a developer can refactor the code in a commit, but this change may end up inducing new smells (or even bugs) along the next commits. However, most of the existing research in this field tends to study these processes in terms of “isolated events” in an oversimplified manner. This talk intends to pinpoint what is missing or even misleading while we focus on understanding design degradation and its recovery in this manner. This discussion will be supported by examples taken from recent or ongoing research. We will also discuss some ideas for future research in the field.</p>
