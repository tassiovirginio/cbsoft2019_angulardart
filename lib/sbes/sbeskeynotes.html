    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>James Herbsleb is a Professor in the Institute for Software Research in the School of Computer Science at
        Carnegie Mellon University, where he serves as Director of the PhD program in Societal Computing. His
        research interests lie primarily in the intersection of software engineering, computer-supported cooperative
        work, and socio-technical systems, focusing on such areas as geographically distributed development teams
        and large-scale open source development. He holds a PhD in psychology, and an MS in computer science.</p>

    <p>His research has won several awards, including the ACM Outstanding Research Award (2016), Alan Newell Award
        for Research Excellence (2014), Most Influential Paper award (ICSE 2010), Honorable Mention for Most
        Influential Paper award (ICSE 2011), ACM Distinguished Paper Award (ICSE 2011), Best Paper Award (Academy of
        Management, 2010), ACM Distinguished Paper Award (ESEM 2008), and Best Paper Award (CSCW 2006).</p>

    <p>For about two decades, he has worked with many extraordinary colleagues to try to understand the complex and
        dynamic relationship between human collaboration and the software that the humans are designing and using.
        On his optimistic days, he feels he has made a bit of progress.</p>
