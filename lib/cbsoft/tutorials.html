    <!-- We invite potential contributors to submit a tutorial to the 10th
    Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice (CBSoft 2019),
    to be held in Salvador, Brazil, between September 23rd and 27th.<br>
    <br>
    CBSoft (https://cbsoft2019.ufba.br) is the major event on Software
    Engineering held annually by the Brazilian Computer Society, aiming at
    promoting and encouraging the exchange of experience between the
    scientific, academic, and professional communities about the latest
    research, trends, and innovations in software. This conference
    integrates four traditional events:<br>
    <br>
    * Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)<br>
    * Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages (SBLP)<br>
    * Brazilian Symposium on Components, Architectures, and Reuse (SBCARS)<br>
    * Brazilian Symposium on Systematic and Automated Software Testing (SAST)<br>
    <br>
    Every year, CBSoft provides five tutorials to the attendants. These
    tutorials are three hours long and are divided into two sections of
    one-and-a-half hours. Tutorials must cover topics in the scope of
    software engineering and programming languages.<br>

                <b>Abstract</b>: Agile software development (ASD) has been increasingly adopted in industry. However,
                recent empirical works have shown that requirements approaches for ASD still neglect non-functional
                requirements (NFRs). From the analysis of recent works, it was noticed that although several studies
                were concerned with privacy requirements, none of them proposes a requirements specification approach to
                be used in the context of ASD. Considering this, the tutorial has the purpose of presenting the overall
                state of privacy in Requirements Engineering (RE) and presenting Privacy Criteria Method (PCM) to deal
                with privacy issues in the context of agile RE.<br>

                <b>Abstract</b>: Software repositories contain many artefacts of qualitative nature, ranging from source
                code comments and commit messages to issue descriptions and documentation. To uncover interesting and
                actionable information about software systems and projects, researchers often have to interpret these
                artefacts using qualitative data analysis methods, e.g., through qualitative coding. In this tutorial,
                we will introduce qualitative coding as an iterative process of individual and team activities and
                discuss how to conduct such qualitative data analysis in a rigorous way to increase the credibility of
                the results.
                We will cover different coding methods as well as the interactive design of a coding guide, and we will
                discuss how to ensure quality in qualitative data analysis. We will conclude the tutorial with a brief
                overview of common pitfalls in qualitative data collection.<br>

                <b>Bio</b>: Christoph Treude is an ARC DECRA Fellow and a Senior Lecturer in the School of Computer
                Science at the University of Adelaide, Australia. He completed his PhD in Computer Science at the
                University of Victoria, Canada, and spent two years in Brazil as a postdoctoral researcher at DIMAp/UFRN
                and IME/USP. The goal of his research is to advance collaborative software engineering through empirical
                studies and the innovation of processes and tools that explicitly take the wide variety of artefacts
                available in a software repository into account.

                <b>Abstract:</b>Software engineering involves the consideration of both human and
                technical factors, and although its origins come from the
                sub-disciplines of computer science and engineering, the importance of
                the social and human aspects of software development are widely
                accepted by current practitioners and researchers alike.  Researchers
                have at their disposal many research methods they can choose from, but
                which methods are best suited to capturing the social and human
                aspects of thesocio-technical endeavour that is software development?
                In this hands-on and interactive tutorial, we will use a research
                strategy framework to distinguish the different strengths and
                weaknesses of how various research methods can capture the human
                aspects of software engineering research.  We will use a design
                science lens to understand the different types of research
                contributions we may encounter in our software engineering research
                projects, and which methods may be best suited to those anticipated
                contribution types (such as descriptive and explanatory theories, or
                technical solutions).

                <b>Abstract:</b> Artificial intelligence has the potential to facilitate collaboration and coordination
                in software development organizations by facilitating access to knowledge, optimizing workflows, and
                coordinating interdependent work. But in order to have a positive impact, it is essential that
                intelligent systems are designed to work harmoniously with the naturally-occurring human processes that
                make groups of people collectively intelligent. This lecture will survey several of the most important
                of these human processes, including social networks, transactive memory, and sense-making in transparent
                environments. It will explain how each mechanism works, how it facilitates organizational performance,
                and how it could potentially be enhanced with smart technologies.

                <b>Bio:</b> James Herbsleb is a Professor in the Institute for Software Research in the School of
                Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. His research interests lie primarily in the intersection
                of software engineering, computer-supported cooperative work, and socio-technical systems, focusing on
                such areas as geographically distributed development teams and large-scale open source development. He
                holds a PhD in psychology, and an MS in computer science. His research has won several awards, including
                the ACM Outstanding Research Award (2016), Alan Newell Award for Research Excellence (2014), Most
                Influential Paper award (ICSE 2010), and distinguished or best paper awards at ICSE, Academy of
                Management, ESEM, and CSCW. For about two decades, he has worked with many extraordinary colleagues to
                try to understand the complex and dynamic relationship between human collaboration and the software that
                the humans are designing and using.

                <b>Abstract:</b> Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) like Coq and Lean are now sophisticated tools
                allowing the proof of highly challenging theorems in a wide range of domains, with highlights such as
                the proof of the Four-color Theorem and the certification of a cryptographic algorithm currently shipped
                within the Chrome browser. Their use is well-established in certain areas of academia, and is slowly
                gaining terrain in the construction of critical software in the industry.<br>
                In a nutshell, an ITP comprises of a language in which to write theorems and proofs, surrounded with an
                ecosystem of tools to help in the process of proof writing. Each step in a proof, which can be executed
                line by line to obtain immediate feedback, can vary from very simple statements, such as "this follows
                from an assumption", to using sophisticated proof search techniques to construct proofs that would
                otherwise take several lines.<br>
                However, despite their maturity, they still present several challenges that remain to be solved. To put
                it succinctly, we do not yet know how to effectively construct proofs, at least not for the wide domains
                in which ITPs are being used. In this tutorial I will provide an introduction to the area in general and
                Coq in particular. and present some of the recent advances aiming at improving ITPs.<br>
