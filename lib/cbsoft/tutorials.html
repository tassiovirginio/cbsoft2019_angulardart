        We invite potential contributors to submit a tutorial to the 10th
        Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice (CBSoft 2019),
        to be held in Salvador, Brazil, between September 23rd and 27th.<br>
        <br>
        CBSoft (https://cbsoft2019.ufba.br) is the major event on Software
        Engineering held annually by the Brazilian Computer Society, aiming at
        promoting and encouraging the exchange of experience between the
        scientific, academic, and professional communities about the latest
        research, trends, and innovations in software. This conference
        integrates four traditional events:<br>
        <br>
        * Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)<br>
        * Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages (SBLP)<br>
        * Brazilian Symposium on Components, Architectures, and Reuse (SBCARS)<br>
        * Brazilian Symposium on Systematic and Automated Software Testing (SAST)<br>
        <br>
        Every year, CBSoft provides five tutorials to the attendants. These
        tutorials are three hours long and are divided into two sections of
        one-and-a-half hours. Tutorials must cover topics in the scope of
        software engineering and programming languages.<br>
