    We invite potential contributors to submit a tutorial to the 10th
    Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice (CBSoft 2019),
    to be held in Salvador, Brazil, between September 23rd and 27th.<br>
    <br>
    CBSoft (https://cbsoft2019.ufba.br) is the major event on Software
    Engineering held annually by the Brazilian Computer Society, aiming at
    promoting and encouraging the exchange of experience between the
    scientific, academic, and professional communities about the latest
    research, trends, and innovations in software. This conference
    integrates four traditional events:<br>
    <br>
    * Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)<br>
    * Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages (SBLP)<br>
    * Brazilian Symposium on Components, Architectures, and Reuse (SBCARS)<br>
    * Brazilian Symposium on Systematic and Automated Software Testing (SAST)<br>
    <br>
    Every year, CBSoft provides five tutorials to the attendants. These
    tutorials are three hours long and are divided into two sections of
    one-and-a-half hours. Tutorials must cover topics in the scope of
    software engineering and programming languages.<br>

                        Resumo: Software repositories contain many artefacts of qualitative
                        nature, ranging from source code comments and commit messages to issue
                        descriptions and documentation. To uncover interesting and actionable
                        information about software systems and projects, researchers often
                        have to interpret these artefacts using qualitative data analysis
                        methods, e.g., through qualitative coding. In this tutorial, we will
                        introduce qualitative coding as an iterative process of individual and
                        team activities and discuss how to conduct such qualitative data
                        analysis in a rigorous way to increase the credibility of the results.
                        We will cover different coding methods as well as the interactive
                        design of a coding guide, and we will discuss how to ensure quality in
                        qualitative data analysis. We will conclude the tutorial with a brief
                        overview of common pitfalls in qualitative data collection.<br>

                        Bio: Christoph Treude is an ARC DECRA Fellow and a Senior Lecturer in
                        the School of Computer Science at the University of Adelaide,
                        Australia. He completed his PhD in Computer Science at the University
                        of Victoria, Canada, and spent two years in Brazil as a postdoctoral
                        researcher at DIMAp/UFRN and IME/USP. The goal of his research is to
                        advance collaborative software engineering through empirical studies
                        and the innovation of processes and tools that explicitly take the
                        wide variety of artefacts available in a software repository into
                        account.

                Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) like Coq and Lean are now sophisticated tools allowing the proof of
                highly challenging theorems in a wide range of domains, with highlights such as the proof of the
                Four-color Theorem and the certification of a cryptographic algorithm currently shipped within the
                Chrome browser. Their use is well-established in certain areas of academia, and is slowly gaining
                terrain in the construction of critical software in the industry.<br>
                <br>
                In a nutshell, an ITP comprises of a language in which to write theorems and proofs, surrounded with an ecosystem of tools to help in the process of proof writing. Each step in a proof, which can be executed line by line to obtain immediate feedback, can vary from very simple statements, such as "this follows from an assumption", to using sophisticated proof search techniques to construct proofs that would otherwise take several lines.<br>
                <br>
                However, despite their maturity, they still present several challenges that remain to be solved. To put it succinctly, we do not yet know how to effectively construct proofs, at least not for the wide domains in which ITPs are being used. In this tutorial I will provide an introduction to the area in general and Coq in particular. and present some of the recent advances aiming at improving ITPs.<br>
