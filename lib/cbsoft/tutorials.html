        We invite potential contributors to submit a tutorial to the 10th
        Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice (CBSoft 2019),
        to be held in Salvador, Brazil, between September 23rd and 27th.<br>
        <br>
        CBSoft (https://cbsoft2019.ufba.br) is the major event on Software
        Engineering held annually by the Brazilian Computer Society, aiming at
        promoting and encouraging the exchange of experience between the
        scientific, academic, and professional communities about the latest
        research, trends, and innovations in software. This conference
        integrates four traditional events:<br>
        <br>
        * Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)<br>
        * Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages (SBLP)<br>
        * Brazilian Symposium on Components, Architectures, and Reuse (SBCARS)<br>
        * Brazilian Symposium on Systematic and Automated Software Testing (SAST)<br>
        <br>
        Every year, CBSoft provides five tutorials to the attendants. These
        tutorials are three hours long and are divided into two sections of
        one-and-a-half hours. Tutorials must cover topics in the scope of
        software engineering and programming languages.<br>

        <b>Title: Interactive theorem proving: where are we now, and where are we going?</b><br>
        <br>
        Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) like Coq and Lean are now sophisticated tools allowing the proof of highly challenging theorems in a wide range of domains, with highlights such as the proof of the Four-color Theorem and the certification of a cryptographic algorithm currently shipped within the Chrome browser. Their use is well-established in certain areas of academia, and is slowly gaining terrain in the construction of critical software in the industry.<br>
        <br>
        In a nutshell, an ITP comprises of a language in which to write theorems and proofs, surrounded with an ecosystem of tools to help in the process of proof writing. Each step in a proof, which can be executed line by line to obtain immediate feedback, can vary from very simple statements, such as "this follows from an assumption", to using sophisticated proof search techniques to construct proofs that would otherwise take several lines.<br>
        <br>
        However, despite their maturity, they still present several challenges that remain to be solved. To put it succinctly, we do not yet know how to effectively construct proofs, at least not for the wide domains in which ITPs are being used. In this tutorial I will provide an introduction to the area in general and Coq in particular. and present some of the recent advances aiming at improving ITPs.<br>
