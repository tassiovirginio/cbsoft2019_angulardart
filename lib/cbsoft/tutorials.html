    We invite potential contributors to submit a tutorial to the 10th
    Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice (CBSoft 2019),
    to be held in Salvador, Brazil, between September 23rd and 27th.<br>
    <br>
    CBSoft (https://cbsoft2019.ufba.br) is the major event on Software
    Engineering held annually by the Brazilian Computer Society, aiming at
    promoting and encouraging the exchange of experience between the
    scientific, academic, and professional communities about the latest
    research, trends, and innovations in software. This conference
    integrates four traditional events:<br>
    <br>
    * Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)<br>
    * Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages (SBLP)<br>
    * Brazilian Symposium on Components, Architectures, and Reuse (SBCARS)<br>
    * Brazilian Symposium on Systematic and Automated Software Testing (SAST)<br>
    <br>
    Every year, CBSoft provides five tutorials to the attendants. These
    tutorials are three hours long and are divided into two sections of
    one-and-a-half hours. Tutorials must cover topics in the scope of
    software engineering and programming languages.<br>

                <b>Abstract</b>: Agile software development (ASD) has been increasingly adopted in industry.  However, recent empirical works have shown that requirements approaches for ASD still neglect non-functional requirements  (NFRs). From the analysis of recent works, it was noticed that although several studies were concerned with privacy requirements, none of them proposes a requirements specification approach to be used in the context of ASD. Considering this, the tutorial has the purpose of presenting the overall state of privacy in Requirements Engineering (RE) and presenting Privacy Criteria Method (PCM)  to deal with privacy issues in the context of agile RE.<br>

                <b>Abstract</b>: Software repositories contain many artefacts of qualitative nature, ranging from source code comments and commit messages to issue descriptions and documentation. To uncover interesting and actionable information about software systems and projects, researchers often have to interpret these artefacts using qualitative data analysis methods, e.g., through qualitative coding. In this tutorial, we will introduce qualitative coding as an iterative process of individual and team activities and discuss how to conduct such qualitative data analysis in a rigorous way to increase the credibility of the results.
                We will cover different coding methods as well as the interactive design of a coding guide, and we will discuss how to ensure quality in qualitative data analysis. We will conclude the tutorial with a brief overview of common pitfalls in qualitative data collection.<br>

                <b>Bio</b>: Christoph Treude is an ARC DECRA Fellow and a Senior Lecturer in the School of Computer Science at the University of Adelaide, Australia. He completed his PhD in Computer Science at the University of Victoria, Canada, and spent two years in Brazil as a postdoctoral researcher at DIMAp/UFRN and IME/USP. The goal of his research is to advance collaborative software engineering through empirical studies and the innovation of processes and tools that explicitly take the wide variety of artefacts available in a software repository into account.

                <b>Abstract:</b> Artificial intelligence has the potential to facilitate collaboration and coordination in software development organizations by facilitating access to knowledge, optimizing workflows, and coordinating interdependent work. But in order to have a positive impact, it is essential that intelligent systems are designed to work harmoniously with the naturally-occurring human processes that make groups of people collectively intelligent. This lecture will survey several of the most important of these human processes, including social networks, transactive memory, and sense-making in transparent environments. It will explain how each mechanism works, how it facilitates organizational performance, and how it could potentially be enhanced with smart technologies.

                <b>Abstract:</b> Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) like Coq and Lean are now sophisticated tools allowing the proof of highly challenging theorems in a wide range of domains, with highlights such as the proof of the Four-color Theorem and the certification of a cryptographic algorithm currently shipped within the Chrome browser. Their use is well-established in certain areas of academia, and is slowly gaining terrain in the construction of critical software in the industry.<br>
                In a nutshell, an ITP comprises of a language in which to write theorems and proofs, surrounded with an ecosystem of tools to help in the process of proof writing. Each step in a proof, which can be executed line by line to obtain immediate feedback, can vary from very simple statements, such as "this follows from an assumption", to using sophisticated proof search techniques to construct proofs that would otherwise take several lines.<br>
                However, despite their maturity, they still present several challenges that remain to be solved. To put it succinctly, we do not yet know how to effectively construct proofs, at least not for the wide domains in which ITPs are being used. In this tutorial I will provide an introduction to the area in general and Coq in particular. and present some of the recent advances aiming at improving ITPs.<br>
