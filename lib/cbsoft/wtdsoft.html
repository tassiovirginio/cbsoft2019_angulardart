    <h2> CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE</h2>

    The IX Workshop on Theses and Dissertations of CBSoft (WTDSoft 2019) is a
    permanent event associated with the Brazilian Congress on Software: Theory
    and Practice (CBSoft), dedicated to the presentation and discussion of
    master&#39;s and doctoral works in progress in the areas of Software
    Engineering and Programming Languages. The CBSoft 2019 will be held in
    Salvador-BA, September 23-27, 2019.

    <h2> THE WORKSHOP</h2>

    CBSoft was created in 2010 to integrate important Brazilian scientific
    events, such as: Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES),
    Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages ​​(SBLP), Brazilian Symposium
    on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse (SBCARS), and Brazilian
    Symposium on Systematic and Automated Software Testing (SAST).
    WTDSoft has its roots in the Workshop on Theses and Dissertations in
    Software Engineering (WTES), an event co-located with SBES from 1996 to
    2010. WTDSoft currently seeks to integrate the SBES, SBLP, SBCARS and SAST
    communities, in order to provide a constructive environment for
    discussions between students with work in progress and researchers in the
    areas of Software Engineering and Programming Languages.

    <h2> ELIGIBILITY AND EVALUATION</h2>

    Masters or doctoral works are eligible for submission, preferably:<br>
    - Doctoral work with a defined proposal (not necessarily approved)<br>
    - Masters work with an approved proposal (desirable, but not mandatory) and expected deadline after December 2019<br>
    - Works that have not been accepted or presented in other workshops on theses and dissertations.<br>
    <br>
    The works will be evaluated and selected by the program committee. Each paper will receive a feedback from the
    committee with questions and suggestions about its content. These comments should be used by the author in the
    preparation of the paper’s final version. Selected papers will be presented and discussed during WTDSoft, with
    program committee members and invited researchers. Acceptance of the work implies the author&#39;s registration in
    WTDSoft (and also in CBSoft) and his/her presence for the presentation of the work. The presentation may be in
    Portuguese or English. We assume that the author is the graduate student responsible for the development of the
    thesis or dissertation.
