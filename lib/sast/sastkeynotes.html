                    <b>Talk: Software Testing in a Digital transformation Journey</b><br>
                    In this new area of digital transformations, testers are seeing a sea of changes on how they traditionally tests software in terms of skills, process and tools. Machine Learning/AI, devops, agile and continuous testing are disrupting the testing community, and forcing them to find ways to test faster and with excellence. In this lecture, Elizangela will share how to overcome the main challenges in automation and performance testing in this context, making the best use of technology such as bots and test tools.
