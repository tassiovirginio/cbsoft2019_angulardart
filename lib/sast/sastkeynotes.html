                    Gordon Fraser is a Full Professor in Computer Science at the
                    University of Passau. He received his Ph.D. from Graz University of
                    Technology, Austria, in 2007, then worked as a post-doc researcher at
                    Saarland University, Germany, and as a (Senior) Lecturer at the
                    University of Sheffield until 2017. He has published on improving
                    software quality and programmer productivity at all major software
                    engineering venues (e.g., TSE, TOSEM, ICSE, ISSTA, FSE, ASE, ICST) and
                    has received six ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards (FSE'14,
                    ISSTA'14, ASE'14, ASE'15, ESEC/FSE'15, ICSE'17), as well as best paper
                    awards at SSBSE and GECCO. He has been
                    programme chair of software engineering conferences (ASE, ICST, TAP,
                    TAIC PART, SSBSE) and workshops, is a regular member of many programme
                    and organising committees in the field (e.g., ICSE, FSE, ASE, ISSTA),
                    is associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
                    (TSE) and Software Testing, Verification, and Reliability (STVR) journals.

                    <b>Talk:Gamifying Software Testing</b><br>

                    Writing good software tests is difficult and not every developerâ€™s favourite occupation. If an activity is so difficult, boring, or otherwise unattractive that people do not want to engage with it, then gamification offers a solution: By turning the activity into a fun and competitive task, participants engage, compete, and excel. In this talk, I will explore how this idea can be applied to software testing. Our ongoing work with the Code Defenders game demonstrates that players engage with testing, and perceive it as a fun activity. At the same time, by participating in the game, players produce test suites that are far superior to anything automated testing tools generate. This illustrates the potential of using gamification to address some of the many problems that we are facing today in software testing. There are, however, many challenges ahead, and I will outline some of the challenges and research opportunities related to gamifying software testing.

                        Alan Gularte is a Senior Software Engineering at Dell. Since 2013 he is supporting global performance testing and quality engineering programs, leading distributed teams in Brazil and India. He joined Dell after 6 years working as a web and mobile developer. He has Specialization in Big Data & Data Science and is always involved with innovation initiatives involving automation to merge Quality Engineering with Artificial Intelligence.

                        Alan is passionate about technology and people management, because he believes both areas need to walk together. He loves traveling (especially to Italy and India) and meeting people from different cultures.

                    <b>Talk: Software Testing in a Digital transformation Journey</b><br>
                    In this new area of digital transformations, testers are seeing a sea of changes on how they traditionally tests software in terms of skills, process and tools. 
                    Machine Learning/AI, devops, agile and continuous testing are disrupting the testing community, and forcing them to find ways to test faster and with excellence. 
                    In this lecture, Alan Gularte will share how to overcome the main challenges in automation and performance testing in this context, making the best use of technology such as bots and test tools.
