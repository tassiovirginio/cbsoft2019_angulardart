<page language="en,pt" title="IV Brazilian Symposium on Systematic and Automated Software Testing (SAST)">

Software testing is one of the most popular Software Verification and Validation techniques used currently in the software industry. When applied effectively, this technique can provide important evidences regarding the quality and reliability of a software system.<br><br>

The current scenario shows that we are increasingly dependent on software in daily activities and industrial environments, emerging a growing need for fast and correct answers of these systems, which are often critical, pervasive, persistent, mobile, distributed, real-time, embbedded, and adaptive. This need drives the development of techniques, criteria and supporting tools for software testing considering the different application domains and programming paradigms.<br><br>

After its debut in 2016, SAST will promote its 4rd edition, although it existed since 2007 with the name of Brazilian Workshop on Systematic and Automated Software Testing. This is the main scientific event on software testing in Brazil. Its goal is to promote an annual forum to discuss issues on the systematization and automation of software testing activity, promoting interaction between researchers and industry in order to strengthen cooperation and innovation in this important area of software development.<br><br>

<h2>Call for Papers</h2><br>
<br>
Software testing is of central importance to verify and validate software systems. Moreover, empirical studies show that test-related activities often account for over 50% of software development costs.
<br>
Systematic and automated approaches have shown capable of reducing this overwhelming cost. Industrial success cases have been openly reported, and academic interest continues to grow as observed by the growing number of researchers in the field. The primary goal of SAST is to build a forum that brings the research and industry communities together to discuss improvements in software testing systematization and automation regarding different categories of software systems.
<br>
In its 4th edition as symposium co-located with the Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice (CBSOFT), SAST invites the entire community to attend the event. During this period, Salvador is the place to be for those interested in Systematic and Automated Software Testing.
