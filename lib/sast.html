<page language="en,pt" title="IV Brazilian Symposium on Systematic and Automated Software Testing (SAST)">

Software testing is one of the most popular Software Verification and Validation techniques used currently in the software industry. When applied effectively, this technique can provide important evidences regarding the quality and reliability of a software system.<br><br>

The current scenario shows that we are increasingly dependent on software in daily activities and industrial environments,
emerging a growing need for fast and correct answers of these systems, which are often critical, pervasive, persistent, mobile, distributed, real-time, embbedded, and adaptive. This need drives the development of techniques, criteria and supporting tools for software testing considering the different application domains and programming paradigms.<br><br>

After its debut in 2016, SAST will promote its 4rd edition, although it existed since 2007 with the name of Brazilian Workshop on Systematic and Automated Software Testing. This is the main scientific event on software testing in Brazil. Its goal is to promote an annual forum to discuss issues on the systematization and automation of software testing activity, promoting interaction between researchers and industry in order to strengthen cooperation and innovation in this important area of software development.<br><br>
