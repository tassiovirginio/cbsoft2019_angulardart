                    <b>Title: Lessons and Insights from Tech Transfers at Microsoft</b><br>
                    As a basic industrial research lab, Microsoft Research expects its members to both publish basic
                    research and put it into practice. Unfortunately, moving from a validated technique or model in a
                    published paper to a state where that same technique is being used by and providing value to
                    software development projects on a regular basis in a consistent and timely fashion is a time
                    consuming, fraught, and difficult task. We have attempted to make this transition, which we call
                    "Tech Transfer", many times in the empirical software engineering group (ESE) at Microsoft Research.
                    Much like research in general, there have been both triumphs and setbacks, but each experience has
                    provided valuable insight and informed our next effort. This talk shares our experiences from
                    successes and failures and provides lessons and guidance that can be used by others trying to
                    transfer their research into practice in both industrial and academic contexts.

                <p>Christian Bird is a principal researcher in the Empirical Software Engineering group at Microsoft
                    Research. He is primarily interested in the relationship between software design, social dynamics,
                    and processes in large development projects and in developing tools and techniques to help software
                    teams. He has studied software development both quantitatively and qualitatively at Microsoft, IBM,
                    and in the Open Source realm. Most recently his work has focused on code review, use of branching in
                    source code repositories, and release engineering. He has published in the top Software Engineering
                    venues and his research has been highlighted in the Communications of the ACM. Christian received
                    B.S. from Brigham Young University and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Davis.</p>

                <b>Title:From Sketch to Code - A Journey of Architects Perceptions on Whiteboard Architectural Meetings</b>
                <br><br>
                Abstract: The design of a software architecture is not purely a technical issue. It also involves numerous social, human and organizational aspects that can influence the success of an architecture and thus an entire project considerably. Therefore, the focus is on the people involved, mainly, the software architect.
                <br><br>
                The software architect is an experienced member in the development team responsible to make design choices, validate them, capture them in various related artifacts, and communicate those decisions to interested stakeholders. The software engineering community has started to study more the role of software architects and their responsibilities. However, studies involving software architects working in different companies, and domains, with different cultures and experiences are welcome, since we do not have a sufficient understanding of what novice and experienced software architects do when they design, evaluate, and document a software architecture. 
                <br><br>
                In this talk, we present the results of semi-structured interviews with 28 software architects from five different countries working on a wide range of application domains. Our goal was to understand the perceptions from software architects on whiteboard architecture meetings and to understand the transition from architectural sketches to code. Based on the results, we provide a set of recommendations for researchers and practitioners.
