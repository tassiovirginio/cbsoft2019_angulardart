                <p>Christian Bird is a researcher in the Empirical Software Engineering group at Microsoft Research. He
                    is primarily interested in the relationship between software design, social dynamics, and processes
                    in large development projects and in developing tools and techniques to help software teams. He has
                    studied software development both quantitatively and qualitatively at Microsoft, IBM, and in the
                    Open Source realm. Most recently his work has focused on code review, use of branching in source
                    code repositories, and release engineering. He has published in the top Software Engineering venues,
                    has received four ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished papers, and his research has been highlighted in the
                    Communications of the ACM. Christian received B.S. from Brigham Young University and his Ph.D. from
                    the University of California, Davis.</p>
