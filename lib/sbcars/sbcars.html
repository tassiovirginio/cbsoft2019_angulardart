<page language="en,pt" title="XIII Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse (SBCARS 2019)">


        The Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse (SBCARS) is promoted by the Brazilian
        Computer Society (SBC) and attracts researchers, students, and practitioners interested in a broad range of
        software engineering topics, including software product lines, component-based development, architectures, and
        reuse. Previous editions of the symposium offered a strong technical program, keynote talks by leaders in the
        field, and tutorials regarding state-of-art topics. SBCARS 2019 intends to continue this tradition.

        <br>
        <br>
        In this context, we are looking for high-quality submissions for SBCARS 2019.

        <h3>Submission Format (Triple-blind Review)</h3>

        <p>Submitted papers can be written in Portuguese or English. Papers written in Portuguese need to be submitted
                with the title, abstract, and keywords written in English. Submissions in English are strongly
                encouraged since the symposium proceedings will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library. At least one
                author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper in person during
                the event. Otherwise, the paper will not be included in the proceedings.</p>

        <p>It is strongly encouraged that authors check papers from previous editions of SBCARS to reference related
                work whenever it is applicable. This might motivate and improve discussions between researchers working
                in the same area during the symposium. SBCARS papers published in previous editions are available at
                <a
                        href="http://dblp1.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sbcars/index.html">http://dblp1.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sbcars/index.html</a>
        </p>

        <p>All submissions must be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and must comply with the ACM 2-column
                conference (ACM_SigConf) format available at <a
                        href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>.
                Papers must be no longer than 10 pages, including figures, tables, and references. Submissions not in
                compliance with the required format and out of the technical scope will be rejected without reviewing.
        </p>

        <p>Submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three referees, based on its originality, relevance, technical
                soundness, and clarity of presentation.</p>

        <p>SBCARS 2019 will employ a triple-blind review process. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors'
                identities in any way.</p>

        * Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission.<br>
        * Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is,
        "the prior work of XYZ" as opposed to "our prior work".<br>
        * Authors should avoid providing URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, data sets). The paper can mention the
        existence of such sites, but the visit of such sites should not be needed to conduct the review.<br>
        * Authors should anonimize author-revealing company names, yet can provide general characteristics of the
        organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper.<br>
        <br>
        <p>Papers should be submitted electronically through EasyChair at
                <a
                        href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sbcars2019">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sbcars2019</a>
        </p>

        <p>When submitting your paper, you must specify the language of your paper with a prefix in the field of the
                paper title in the submission platform. The title of papers in English must start with "[EN]" and the
                title of papers in Portuguese must start with "[PT]". This guarantees that your paper is assigned to a
                reviewer that will be able to review your paper.</p>

        <br>
        <h3> Best Paper Award and Special Issue </h3><br>

        - SBCARS organizers will award the Best Papers prize of the symposium, which will be announced during the event.
        The authors of best papers will be invited to submit an extended version to a special issue of the JBCS -
        Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society (<a
