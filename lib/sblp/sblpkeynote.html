    <H2>Short Bio:</H2>
    <br />
    <P>
        Beta Ziliani is a researcher and lecturer in the group LIIS at FAMAF, Universidad Nacional
        de Córdoba (UNC), and CONICET. He did a PhD with honors at the MPI-SWS under the
        supervision of Dr. Derek Dreyer, a and a MSc (licenciatura) at FCEyN, Universidad de
        Buenos Aires (UBA), under the supervision of Alejandro Ríos.
        Beta's research primarily focuses on improving interactive theorem provers (ITPs), and
        the application of ITPs to the verification of proofs. The Mtac projects (Mtac1 and
        Mtac2) are his most renown work within the community of functional programming in
        general, and Coq in particular.</P>

    <H2>Talk Title:</H2>
    Using dependent types to build robust tactics in Coq. <br />
    <br />

    <H2>Talk Abstract:</H2>
    <br />
    <P>Coq is an interactive theorem prover (ITP) that contains a rich dependent type theory, using the Curry-Howard
        isomorphism to encode proofs as proof terms in the theory. Luckily, the user does not need to construct proof
        terms by hand: Coq also includes a tactic language, incorporating a more easy-to-use language to build ---and
        automate--- proofs. Like similar ITPs, the tactic language and the theory of the proof assistant are strictly
        separated, the former being mostly untyped, making tactics hard to build, maintain, and compose. The Mtac
        genealogy of projects (Mtac1 and Mtac2) brought a whole new concept to ITPs in general and Coq in particular: it
        mixes the two languages by encoding in a monad the primitives required to construct meta-programs (Mtac1) and
        tactics (Mtac2). Tactics written in Mtac's monad inherits the rich type system of Coq, to far-reaching
        consequences we are yet to explore. In this talk I will present our latest discoveries using dependent types to
        build concise and safe tactics.</P>

    <H2>Short Bio:</H2>

    <p>José Valim is the creator of the Elixir programming language. He graduated in Engineering from the Polytechnic
        School of USP and holds a master's degree from Politecnico di Torino in Italy. He is co-founder and Director of
        R & D of Plataformatec, a consultancy based in São Paulo. He is the author of the Adopting Elixir, Phoenix
        Programming, and Crafting Rails Applications books. Valim also received the prizes of Ruby Hero (2010) and
        Erlang User of the Year (2015) and currently lives in Krakow, Poland, which has great summers, but the winters
        are very cold (at least for a Brazilian).</p>

    <br />
    <H2>Talk Title:</H2>
    Languages to Build Distributed and Fault Tolerant Applications with Elixir.
    <br /><br />


    <H2>Talk Abstract:</H2>
    <p>
        In this talk, José Valim will give an introduction to the Elixir and the Erlang virtual machine and show how
        they use a new vocabulary for developers to build applications that are competing, distributed and fault
        tolerant. The presentation will also discuss Elixir's design goals and will include live demos.
